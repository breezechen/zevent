/*
 * The shared-memory segment header can be cast to and from the
 * SHMCBHeader type, all other structures need to be initialised by
 * utility functions.
 *
 * The "header" looks like this;
 *
 * data applying to the overall structure:
 * - division_offset (unsigned int):
 *   how far into the shared memory segment the first division is.
 * - division_size (unsigned int):
 *   how many bytes each division occupies.
 *   (NB: This includes the queue and the cache)
 * - division_mask (unsigned char):
 *   the "mask" in the next line. Add one to this,
 *   and that's the number of divisions.
 *
 * data applying to within each division:
 * - queue_size (unsigned int):
 *   how big each "queue" is. NB: The queue is the first block in each
 *   division and is followed immediately by the cache itself so so
 *   there's no cache_offset value.
 *
 * data applying to within each queue:
 * - index_num (unsigned char):
 *   how many indexes in each cache's queue
 * - index_offset (unsigned char):
 *   how far into the queue the first index is.
 * - index_size:
 *   how big each index is.
 *
 * data applying to within each cache:
 * - cache_data_offset (unsigned int):
 *   how far into the cache the session-data array is stored.
 * - cache_data_size (unsigned int):
 *   how big each cache's data block is.
 *
 * statistics data (this will eventually be per-division but right now
 * there's only one mutex):
 * - stores (unsigned long):
 *   how many stores have been performed in the cache.
 * - expiries (unsigned long):
 *   how many session have been expired from the cache.
 * - scrolled (unsigned long):
 *   how many sessions have been scrolled out of full cache during a
 *   "store" operation. This is different to the "removes" stats as
 *   they are requested by mod_ssl/Apache, these are done because of
 *   cache logistics. (NB: Also, this value should be deducible from
 *   the others if my code has no bugs, but I count it anyway - plus
 *   it helps debugging :-).
 * - retrieves_hit (unsigned long):
 *   how many session-retrieves have succeeded.
 * - retrieves_miss (unsigned long):
 *   how many session-retrieves have failed.
 * - removes_hit (unsigned long):
 * - removes_miss (unsigned long):
 * 
 * Following immediately after the header is an array of "divisions".
 * Each division is simply a "queue" immediately followed by its
 * corresponding "cache". Each division handles some pre-defined band
 * of sessions by using the "division_mask" in the header. Eg. if
 * division_mask=0x1f then there are 32 divisions, the first of which
 * will store sessions whose least-significant 5 bits are 0, the second
 * stores session whose LS 5 bits equal 1, etc. A queue is an indexing
 * structure referring to its corresponding cache.
 *
 * A "queue" looks like this;
 *
 * - first_pos (unsigned int):
 *   the location within the array of indexes where the virtual
 *   "left-hand-edge" of the cyclic buffer is.
 * - pos_count (unsigned int):
 *   the number of indexes occupied from first_pos onwards.
 *
 * ...followed by an array of indexes, each of which can be
 * memcpy'd to and from an SHMCBIndex, and look like this;
 *
 * - expires (time_t):
 *   the time() value at which this session expires.
 * - offset (unsigned int):
 *   the offset within the cache data block where the corresponding
 *   session is stored.
 * - s_id2 (unsigned char):
 *   the second byte of the session_id, stored as an optimisation to
 *   reduce the number of d2i_SSL_SESSION calls that are made when doing
 *   a lookup.
 * - removed (unsigned char):
 *   a byte used to indicate whether a session has been "passively"
 *   removed. Ie. it is still in the cache but is to be disregarded by
 *   any "retrieve" operation.
 *
 * A "cache" looks like this;
 *
 * - first_pos (unsigned int):
 *   the location within the data block where the virtual
 *   "left-hand-edge" of the cyclic buffer is.
 * - pos_count (unsigned int):
 *   the number of bytes used in the data block from first_pos onwards.
 *
 * ...followed by the data block in which actual DER-encoded SSL
 * sessions are stored.

/*
* void HASH_MIX
*
* DESCRIPTION:
*
* Mix 3 32-bit values reversibly.  For every delta with one or two bits
* set, and the deltas of all three high bits or all three low bits,
* whether the original value of a,b,c is almost all zero or is
* uniformly distributed.
*
* If HASH_MIX() is run forward or backward, at least 32 bits in a,b,c
* have at least 1/4 probability of changing.  If mix() is run
* forward, every bit of c will change between 1/3 and 2/3 of the
* time.  (Well, 22/100 and 78/100 for some 2-bit deltas.)
*
* HASH_MIX() takes 36 machine instructions, but only 18 cycles on a
* superscalar machine (like a Pentium or a Sparc).  No faster mixer
* seems to work, that's the result of my brute-force search.  There
* were about 2^68 hashes to choose from.  I only tested about a
* billion of those.
